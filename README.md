# Chat Application

This is a chat application that uses web sockets for real-time data transfer. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. First clone the repository to your local machine. Next, you will want to make sure you have [NODE](nodejs.org) installed. Then, do an npm install to bring load in all of the dependencies from the package.json. Lastly, you can run npm run dev to run the application in development environment.
